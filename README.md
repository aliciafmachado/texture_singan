# singan
Synthèse de textures par réseaux antagonistes génératifs (SinGAN).

Main code in SinGAN.ipynb notebook.

In order to run the code, you need to replace sifid_score.py of SinGAN original repository by the file here. Other than that, you might find pm_minimal.cpp in this file. The extra images are in imgs, and results are in results. We also leave the results of using pm_minimal.cpp in results_patch.
